            Think about what metrics are you going to use to determine your success? This makes a goal more
            tangible because it provides a way to measure progress. If it’s a project that’s going to take a
            few months to complete, then set some milestones by considering specific tasks to accomplish.
            Milestones are a series of steps along the way that when added up will result in the completion
            of your main goal.

                    As the "M" in SMART states, there should be a source of information to
                    measure or determine whether a goal has been achieved.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The M can be either a direct or indirect indicator of what success for
                    a particular goal would look like.

                <p>
                    In regards to group work, if measurement becomes difficult, group
                    members will need to work together in order to identify the most
                    relevant and viable data sources and collection methods.

            <li>
                <p>
                    Data collection efforts needed to measure a goal could be included in the
                    goal's action plan.

                    Measurement methods can be both quantitative and qualitative.
