            When goal-setting, be specific about what you want to accomplish.
            Consider this the mission statement for your goal. Bear in mind,
            this isn't a detailed list of how you're going to meet a goal.
            Rather, it should include an answer to one of the following types
            of questions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Who – Consider all those who need to be involved in order to
                    achieve the goal. This is particularly important when you're
                    working on a group project.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    What – Think about exactly what you are trying to accomplish,
                    being as descriptive as possible.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When – This question is answered more specifically in the
                    time-bound part of creating a SMART goal. That said, you still
                    need to identify a roundabout timeframe.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Where – This may not always apply, especially when you're
                    setting personal goals. However, if there is a specific
                    location or relevant event, be sure to identify it here.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Which – Determine any and all related obstacles or
                    requirements that you will need to overcome in order
                    to achieve your goal. This can be particularly beneficial
                    when it comes to deciding if your goal is realistic.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Why – Consider why achieving the goal is important to you
                    as an individual.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Examples of "Specific" actions include:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <table>
                        <tr><td>oversee</td><td>update</td><td>write</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>coordinate</td><td>upgrade</td><td>process</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>supervise</td><td>develop</td><td>provide</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>manage</td><td>create</td><td>maintain</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>plan</td><td>implement</td><td>reconcile</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>support</td><td>evaluate</td><td>direct</td></tr>
                        <tr><td>transition</td><td>produce</td><td>administer</td></tr>
                    </table>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep in mind, verbs such as "improve", "reduce" or "increase"
                    (e.g. "improve customer service", "reduce costs" or "increase
                    daily users") are not included above. These all imply the
                    direction that one would want a result to move in, however,
                    they don't do much to explain the role or specific actions
                    that they would take in order to accomplish that change.
