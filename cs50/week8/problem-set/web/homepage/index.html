    <h2>How do I decide the right scope for my goals?</h2>
    <body>
        <p>
            SMART goals are designed to address all of your major academic or
            professional responsibilities. Bear in mind, goals are intended to
            focus attention and resources on all that is important so that you
            can be successful in achieving your priorities. Specifically, SMART
            goals are those for the workplace.
        </p>
    </body>

    <h2>Where do I start?</h2>
    <body>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Start by evaluating your specific role within your organisation and
                    the broad areas of responsibility and results for which you are
                    accountable.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Develop over-arching goal statements for each bucket. Keep in mind,
                    in order to get scope right, you need to prioritise end results as
                    opposed to individual tasks.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Goals should be high level enough to encompass the core outcomes
                    for which you are responsible. However, they must simultaneously be
                    specific and clear enough so that you are able to measure success.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Evaluate all ongoing responsibilities, new projects, assignments,
                    priorities or initiatives. Your goals should be focused on the
                    aforementioned.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Having too many goals can be an indicator that your goals are
                    scoped at too low of a level and are focused more on tasks as
                    opposed to end results.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If it seems that your goals are becoming too numerous and
                    task-oriented, it may be helpful to consider combining several goal
                    statements into a broader outcome area.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>
